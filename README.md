## PROCESS

1.Define the Goal: Start by deciding exactly what problem the dashboard needs to solve, like tracking sales or improving customer scores.
2.Clean the Data: Gather all the necessary raw information and make sure it is perfectly tidy and consistent for accurate analysis.
3.Plan the Layout: Draw a sketch or rough draft to figure out where all the charts and main numbers should sit on the screen.
4.Create the Visuals: Build all the specific charts and add the interactive filters so people can easily play with the data themselves.
5.Check for Insights: Look closely at the completed dashboard to find the key business takeaways and confirm the results with the team.
6.Share the Report: Finalize the dashboard and officially publish it so the entire company can start using it to guide their decisions.

## PROJECT INSIGHT

1.The analysis must reveal which product categories (Item Types) drive the highest overall revenue and possess the best customer satisfaction ratings.
2.We need to determine if there is a clear consumer preference for products based on their Fat Content and how that trend varies between different retail outlets.
3.A key finding will be identifying the most profitable Outlet Size and Outlet Type to guide future resource allocation and investment decisions.
4.The data should clearly show whether the age of an outlet (Establishment Year) positively or negatively impacts its long-term sales performance.
5.Finally, the project must pinpoint geographic locations (Outlet Location) that are underperforming or present the biggest untapped market potential for expansion.

## FINAL CONCLUSION

The objective of conducting a comprehensive analysis of Blinkit's sales performance, customer satisfaction, and inventory distribution has been successfully fulfilled by the dashboard, and the various derived insights can be directly used for future business improvements and optimization opportunities.
